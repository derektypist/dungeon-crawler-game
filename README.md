# Dungeon Crawler Game

The purpose of the project is to provide a dungeon crawler game.  The aim is to kill the boss in dungeon 4.

## UX

As a user, I have a health, a level and a weapon.  I can pick up a better weapon.  I can pick up health items.

As a user, I expect all the items and enemies on the map to be arranged at random.

As a user, I can move throughout a map, discovering all items.

As a user, I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries.  But I cannot move through an enemy, until I have beaten it.

As a user, I expect much of the map to be hidden.  When I take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from me are revealed.

As a user, when I beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and I get XP, which eventually increases my level.

As a user, when I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses.I do damage based off of my level and my weapon. 
The enemy does damage based off of its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.

As a user, when I find and beat the boss, I win.

As a user, I expect the game to be challenging, but theoretically winnable.
